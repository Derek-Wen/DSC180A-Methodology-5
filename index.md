**Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**\
<ul>
  <li>Detecting if a powerline pole has been tilting during the past few years. </li>
  <li>Measuring tree growth. </li>
  <li>Risk assessment of powerlines in terms of deteriorating quality</li>
</ul>

**What is a potential change youâ€™d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**\
Explore different types of machine learning models and figure out more tools provided by Google's API.
